actual tax rate and tax amount for the user based on the users' input.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned that in order for the "Clear Calculator" button to work, we need to add the GetElementById() method and add empty quotations as the value. 
 ex:  document.getElementById("taxBracket").innerHTML=""; .
2. I learned that it is much harder to do the else if statements versus switch statements. It is a much longer process and also much harder for the coder to read, but it does execute the same result.
3. The innerHTML property used with the document.getElementById() sets or returns the HTML content (inner HTML) of an element.
